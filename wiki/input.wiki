||dci || time || collect and print some stats in outputfile every `[`time`]` sec.||
||sim`_`length || time || sim length expressed in sec (override the length written in the workload).||
||output || outputfile || output file.||
||queue`_`discipline || FIFO/DRR || queuing discipline, FIFO or DRR (applied at each node).||
||cache || AUTO/LRU/RND/NO `[`cache size`]` ||caching policy, AUTO means "cache policy/size specified in the topology file; `[`cache size`]` in kbit.||
||startup || time || does not collect stats for `[`time`]` sec. ||
||req`_`order || SEQ/RND || chunk request order (SEQ = 1,2,3,...N or RND). ||
||flow`_`controller || ICP/FIX win var/fix timer limit || flow controller (applied at each download), Interest window ICP (AIMD) or fix, with size `[`win`]`, var/fix receiver time out of `[`timer`]` sec., limit indicates the max number of interest re-expressions allowed.||
|| || RAQM pmax beta win limit S ||  Interest window RAQM (AIMD) with max probability decrese `[`pmax`]` and decrease factor `[`beta]. `[`win`]` is the initial window size and `[`limit`]` indicates the max number of interest re-expressions allowed. S = `[`source / no`_`source`]` indicates if RAQM collects global or per source RTT stats. ||
|| || CBR win rate || Controller with fix window size `[`win]. Sends an entire window of interests `[`rate`]` times per second. 
No interest re-expression is allowed.||
