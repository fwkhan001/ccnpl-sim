The installation procedure downloads the required packages and checkout the source code of the simulator from the svn repository. The simulator is written in C++ and you need automake gcc and the boost library in your system.

To retrieve the installation script do

{{{
svn co https://ccnpl-sim.googlecode.com/svn/tags/ccnpl-sim-0.1.0
cd ccnpl-sim-0.1.0
sh install.sh 
}}}

To get some examples with simulation scripts and output postprocessing.

{{{
svn co https://ccnpl-sim.googlecode.com/svn/tags/examples

NOTE: If you are yusing gcc version 4.6 (or higher) you need to include the cstddef library in the ssim.cc file (ssim-1.7.5 package). 

At the beginning of ssim.cc
{{{ 
#include <cstddef> 
}}}
